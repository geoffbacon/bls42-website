*The Berkeley Linguistics Society has been operating since 1975, making us the second oldest graduate student run linguistics society in the United States. This is our 42nd conference.*

The template for this website comes from the wonderful HTML5UP crew, who distribute beautiful, responsive websites for free under the Creative Commons License (see README-HTML5UP.txt for more info). I simple added BLS specific content and modified a few things. They make incredible website templates that I could never dream of creating myself.
